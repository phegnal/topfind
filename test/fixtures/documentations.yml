  title: Evidence filter
  long:  By default, all known data is incorporated into the results page. This can be customized through a filter accessible at the top right of the page. After filtering, only data that is backed with evidence matching the given filter settings is incorporated. This will affect the termini, cleavage sites and substrates listed. Also the network view will only consider matching connections and the cleavage site preference is only built on data matching the criteria.
