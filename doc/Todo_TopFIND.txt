Get Update page running - why isn't it working on the server?

Get position of evidences (comma separated) in the table returned by TopFINDer 
	--> when doing this, TopFINDer can also be optimized by doing protein.nterms instead of Nterm.find(:condition)
	--> same for Cterms and Cleavages

Chromosomes from NextProt

Isoform problem: P35398-2 doesn’t map anywhere because it’s the main isoform

add NextProt protein status (missing proteins) to TopFIND

check again about the alternative splicing annotation vs uniprot isoforms (reduce overlaps)

improve TISdb mapping - get more evidences from TopFIND

text mining articles for cleavage and inhibition

handle emailing - what about failed emails? (see google account)

PathFINDer speed with long paths / lists - improve code?

upload more papers on terminomics -- work on submission forms

protease cleavage prediction based on specificity profiles?

add rat to topfind (email by anne Døskeland) (on 8,000 swissprot entries in rat!)
