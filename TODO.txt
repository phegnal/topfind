add rat to topfind (email by anne Døskeland)

Get position of evidences (comma separated) in the table returned by TopFINDer
update protein names (P39900) —> don’t use search names as protein names, use what’s displayed online, rename column in Fulltable.txt
Chromosomes read from BioMart - should get it from somewhere else but have to see about that? - NeXtProt - Get chromosomes from Uniprot (Proteome’s column)

Isoform errors: P35398-2 doesn’t map anywhere because it’s the main isoform

add NextProt protein status (missing proteins) to TopFIND
check again about the alternative splicing annotation vs uniprot isoforms (reduce overlaps)

improve TISdb mapping - get more evidences from TopFIND

text mining articles for cleavage and inhibition
handle emailing - what about failed emails? (see google account)

PathFINDer speed with long paths / lists - improve code?
upload more papers on terminomics -- work on submission forms
protease cleavage prediction based on specificity profiles?
