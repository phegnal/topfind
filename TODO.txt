add rat to topfind (email by anne Døskeland)

Isoform errors: P35398-2 doesn’t map anywhere because it’s the main isoform
Get chromosomes from Uniprot (Proteome’s column)


1. Chromosomes read from BioMart - should get it from somewhere else but have to see about that? - NeXtProt
2. add NextProt protein status (missing proteins) to TopFIND
3. check again about the alternative splicing annotation vs uniprot isoforms (reduce overlaps)
4. Learn about Methionine cleavage, how often does it happen?
5. Get position of evidences (comma separated) in the table returned by TopFINDer
6. update protein names (P39900)

text mining articles for cleavage and inhibition
handle emailing - what about failed emails? (see google account)
improve TISdb mapping - get more evidences from TopFIND
PathFINDer speed with long paths / lists - improve code?
upload more papers on terminomics -- work on submission forms
protease cleavage prediction based on specificity profiles?
